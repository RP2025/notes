Top 16 funds and manager teams use growth, value, activist, 
investor-operator, and crossover methods.

Assess the science, analyze the business, value the company with 
little data and cash flow.

### Firms

BVF (led by Mark Lampert) was founded in 1992 as a pioneer in biotech 
value. Finds underrated drug companies and creates event or waits.

EcoR1 (led by Oleg Nodelman) came from BVF and was founded in 2013. 
Focuses on value investing, esp. unfollowed clinical trials, 
misunderstood pipelines, and insufficient capital. Doesn't focus on 
hard-to-predict science.

The Column Group (led by David Goeddel, Peter Svennilson, and 
Richard Klausner) is very science-driven and takes active role in 
early-stage drug companies specifically.

Baker Brothers (led by Felix and Julian Baker) use multi-decade 
investing and take an active role.

Perceptive Advisors (led by Joseph Edelman) focuses on investor 
psychology (event perception), credit investments, and venture.

Kleiner Perkins (led by Brook Byers and Beth Seidenberg) bet big on 
Genentech.

âœ… Third Rock Ventures (led by Mark Levin, Kevin Starr, and Alexis 
Borisy) uses investor-operator model. Created machine to sift through 
scientific data, form an idea to generate clinical data, finance a 
company, and place a partner as the CEO.

Atlas Venture (led by Bruce Booth and Michiel de Haan) focuses on 
clinical demand and ownership to gets 1st dibs on asset spinoffs.

Deerfield (led by James Flynn) does public equity, credit to 
private investments, academic collabs, and philanthropy.

ARCH Venture Partners (led by Bob Nelson and Kristina Burow) started 
as a UChicago and Argonne Natl Lab commercialization project. It 
pioneered the private megaround (up to $1B in a round!).

Venrock (led by Bryan Roberts) focused on scientific breakthroughs and 
unmet needs. Big LP base gives flexibility and long time horizons.

Polaris Partners (led by Terry McGuire and Alan Crane) is based in 
Boston.

RA Capital Management (led by Peter Kolchinsky) focuses on scientific 
integrity. Tries to predict if drug will work and is valuable with 
current runway. Created TechAtlas to map out scientific research and 
drug development programs to identify gaps.

âœ… Foresight Capital (led by Jim Tananbaum) uses data-driven methods 
to process clinical, research, marketing, and regulatory data. Likes 
large-scale data. Flexible across private/public and rounds.

OrbiMed (led by Jonathan Silverstein and Carl Gordon) does small-cap, 
venture, debt, and more. Huge fund.

5AM Ventures (led by Andrew Schwab and Kush Parmar) pioneered the 
investor-operator model for life sciences.

## The Century of Biology

White blood cell therapies, gene editing, pills for cystic fibrosis, 
CRISPR therapies for sickle cell anemia all within past 20 years.

Medicines with human studies fail 90% of the time.

Electronic health records are siloed and unstructured.

ðŸ“ˆ FDA drug approvals are up 70% compared to 2000-2010 and 25% compared to 
1990-2000.

New medicines for common diseases need huge studies w 1000s of patients.

Many drugs have been rescinded due to side effects
  * Paxil (depression), Vioxx (arthritis), Ketek (antibiotic), 
  Avandia (diabetes), Zelnorm (IBS), Bextra (arthritis), Meridia (weight)

Cost per trial patient has skyrocketed from $10k to $500k.

New strategy is rare disease treatments to test less and charge more.
  * MS, rheumatoid arthritis, rare cancers, cystic fibrosis.
  * ðŸ“ˆ Avg. new medicine price in 2007 = $2k, 2021 = $180k.

UK NHS used large datasets to test Covid treatment efficacies.
  * Take little data from many people. Big, simple trials.

Don't replace trials with databases. Need randomization and control!

Don't focus on hot new tech, focus on improving the testing system.
  * Too much reliance on pharma companies.

Bio vs biotech/engineering -- science is empirical and involves discovery 
with no typical roadmap, while engineering can have plan with incremental 
innovations and systematic progress 

Bioengineering allows reading AND writing biological code.

Advances in sequencing let you see DNA, RNA expression, and proteomics 
with quick turnaround (1 day or less).
  * Can also see on scale of single cell, rather than averaging over many.

ML methods with invariances (translational, e.g.) help find patterns and 
deconvolute signal from noise.

Biotech startups need to navigate the science, scaling, and deployment.

Pande's "cloud biology" idea: make centralized bio mega-labs like AWS 
server farms so that people can easily and efficiently test hypotheses
  * Would help efficiency and reproducibility
  * Main issue is tinkering with tools. Hasn't panned out like ML yet.
