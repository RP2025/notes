# Penn Biotech Group Pitch Competition

From mid March to late April, the Penn Biotech Group ran its first stock pitch
competition. The goals were to gain exposure and experience in biotech
investing, especially in public markets.

## Rules

The competition attracted masters students, PhDs, and postdocs from PBG alike.
We had around 20 competitors, each grouped into four teams. I elected to
participate in a solo team, as I wanted to get experience in all aspects of
stock pitching -- vetting the company's leadership team, understanding their
background, digging deep into their products and competitive advantage,
analyzing financial statements, and scouring scientific and legal publications
to learn about the science behind the company's pharmaceutical pipeline.
