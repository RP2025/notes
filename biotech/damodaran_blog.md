Corporate finance has 3 buckets for money
1. Investment -- invest in assets earning return > hurdle rate
  * Hurdle rate reflects risk and mix of debt/equity
  * Return reflects magnitude and timing of cash flows
2. Financing -- acquire debt at correct debt/equity ratio
  * Maximize firm value and match tenor of assets
3. Dividend -- return cash to business owners
  * Dividends or buybacks

Dividends are sometimes given for the wrong reasons, like inertia 
(we used to give dividends, so we can't stop) or me-tooism (other 
similar companies are giving dividends, so we must too).

Measure "free cash flow to equity (FCFE)" = correct dividend value:
  * Plus net income and new borrowings
  * Minus depreciation and amortization, cap ex and acquisitions, 
  change in non-cash working capital, and debt repaid.

FCFE can be negative, and must then be covered by prior cash balances 
or fundraising.

FCFE starts negative in company lifecycle, then steadily grows 
(esp. as a percentage of market cap) over time.

Buybacks used to not exist until 1980s. Now buybacks are far bigger 
than dividends, esp. in USA.
  * Buybacks are now 2:1 against dividends in S&P500.

Buybacks are more flexible than dividends bc dividends become 
expected by shareholders.
  * Dividends not as popular due to business disruption, volatility, 
  and globalization eliminating local market advantages. Need more 
  flexible option like buybacks or special dividends.

Buybacks used to have tax benefit, but no longer do.
  * Dividends are taxed as income as soon as they're paid.
  * Buybacks need not be exercised

### Clearing up misconceptions

Buybacks do not create or destroy firm value, only redistribute it.
  * Can destroy value by not making CORRECT decision, like 
  erroneously borrowing or not funding a worthwhile investment.

Buybacks at high price cause sellers to profit and sitters to lose. 
Buybacks at low price cause sitters to profit and sellers to lose. 
The market (shareholders involved in buyback decision) should thus 
price it efficiently.

Statistically, companies aren't taking on too much debt to fund 
buybacks.

Buybacks aren't stealing money from the economy because of lack of 
self-investment.
  * Investing in bad ventures is always bad.
  * Giving money to owners lets them redistribute into good companies.

Buybacks may be unfair to other shareholders (employees, e.g.) 
because they're not open to all people.
