# Cover Letter

## Goals

Address "why" questions
  * why do you want the job
  * why are your skills/experiences relevant
  * why you are applying and changing fields

Illustrate passion and emotion

Pitch yourself to the recruiter

Share stories overlapping what you're excited about AND what's relevant to employer. 
Stories are small slices of PhD and other experiences

Build tension in story with structure: `quest` - `surprise` - `critical action` 
- `climax` - `outcome`

Equal weight with resume, providing color/depth to experiences

## Formatting

❌ Don't include your or their address

✅ Include only name, email, and phone at top and before sign-off

> If you need any additional information from me, please feel free to contact 
me at `email` or `phone`. I look forward to hearing from you.

Salutation should be
  * "Dear `hiring manager name`"
  * "To the Hiring Manager"
  * "Dear Hiring Manager"

## Paragraph 1

"I am applying for x that was advertised on y."

Then a summary of relevant skills.

❌ Don't rush straight into "I believe I'm a good fit"

✅ Give enough info about yourself BEFORE "I believe my combination of experience 
as x and y is a great fit for this role."

> With x experience doing y during my PhD at Penn, and with z, I am excited 
to bring my passion for q to this role / I believe that my combination of x and y 
is a great fit for this role

## Paragraph 2

Put most relevant and recent experiences first -- doesn't need to be chronological

Use exciting words like "new", "cutting-edge", "dynamic", "novel", "unique", "innovative"
> * When I was doing x, one of the most exciting/challenging tasks was y.
> * It was exciting/challenging to
> * One of the most challenging aspects was
> * It was satisfying/wonderful to see
> * This meant a lot to me
> * I really enjoy
> * I am passionate about
> * I found this to be really energizing
> * ... and I am excited about this new role because

❌ Avoid listing skills -- those belong in a cover letter

✅ Convey a theme with general information about relevant aspects, with drama

> During my PhD in materials science at Penn, I have **developed** two new research 
protocols as part of the 3 research projects I am currently **leading**. 
I have taken every opportunity to keep the tools I am developing to answer 
questions on memory formation at the very **cutting-edge** of this field of study. 
One of my most **challenging** projects has been the development of **new AI** systems 
to analyze our data. We didn’t have any of these tools in our lab, so I had 
to **develop a new relationship** with a faculty member and postdoc from the 
Engineering School, and was able to implement their software to help us 
analyze the data we are about to publish. I really enjoyed learning these new 
skills, teaching them to the other researchers in the lab, and forming what 
has already been a wonderfully **productive collaboration** with our partners.

## Paragraph 3

❌ Don't repeat or reference specifics in resume

✅ Use STARER stories (see Interview markdown file)

Focus on how you approach problems -- collaboration, intense research, etc.

Try to match wording in job description when translating resume -> cover letter
> * Mentored 3 graduate students -> I sought out opportunities to mentor graduate 
students because I have always been energized by the mentoring that I have received 
throughout my academic life.
> * Gained knowledge of 1st-gen student needs by holding 2 focus groups, and used 
data collected to develop 2 workshops -> When I was on the 1st-gen committee, 
I used the data we collected to successfully advocate to the Dean of the School 
for more resources to support our programming. It is really satisfying to 
see that these resources are still provided 3 years after my involvement
> * Collaborated with 4-member team from 3 different schools to perform market 
analysis for a small ed-tech startup as part of consulting club -> As a 
member of a student team working with an ed-tech startup, I quickly brought 
the team together for a skill-sharing icebreaker. This helped us identify the 
skills and knowledge areas we each brought. My idea to spend the first few 
meetings engaged in blue-sky thinking contributed to the innovative ideas our 
team presented to the CEO, which have now been implemented. I really enjoyed the 
learning journey we took as a team to achieve this great outcome.

## Paragraph 4

Answer "Why this employer?" and "What do you gain?"

✅ Put your gains at the end because you need to build connection with reader first

> Having spoken with several Penn alumni who work in this department, including x, 
it is great to know about how helpful your new hire mentoring program is for 
new staff. I have always benefited from strong mentors at Penn, so I would find 
this support to be invaluable.

Highlight knowledge of projects, company culture, and resources

Mention alumni contacts, recruiters, career fairs/sessions

Highlight desire to grow professionally, excitement to bring value, and eagerness to 
be part of their community
