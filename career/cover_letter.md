# Resume

## Goals

3-5 clear takeaway themes / messages 
  * not just “I have education and experience”

Create clear image in recruiter's head of you in that role

Create strong narrative prioritizing relevant skills

Analogy -- complementary ice cream scoops in flavors the recruiter likes

Should sound good when read out loud

## Curb appeal

Notice spacing between sections, consistency

Fill lines with text. Dates don't deserve their own column of whitespace.

Also, dates on left priortize when, not what. Keep dates on right.

Months can be abbreviated

Single column takes control over flow, compared to double column

## Contact Info

Name should be biggest font + at top

LinkedIn URL should be customized to remove random characters

No need for "phone" and "email" qualifiers

Just city and state, not full address

## Bullet points

`Summary` may contain buzzwords and non-specific language

> * Effective collaborator across disciplines, with ability to quickly integrate into new environments and understand needs of communities using ethnograph
> * Skilled in managing extensive, highly variable health data sets using Python, R and mySQ
> * Extensive knowledge and cutting-edge research experience in immuno-oncology, cell and gene therapy, biomarkers and rare disease

`Education` bullets can be condensed like:

**degree, major, school,** city, state ... date 

Not `Work Experience`, but `Relevant Experience` -- no need to include anything 
you did that paid you. 
PhD research should be top relevant experience.
May also include group membership/leadership, volunteering, undergrad research.

Most relevant skills to job at beginning of resume, and beginning of bullet points
  * match exact wording to job description when possible

Format = `skill` - `context` - `outcome` or `primary skill` - `application` - `award/effectiveness`
  * de-emphasize context if not relevant to job

* Adding quantity makes claims more believable and tangible
* Adding context and quality gives better insight
* Using action verbs shows transferrable skills

E.g. TA has skills: subject knowledge, communications, time management, adaptability, 
giving feedback, mentoring, teaching, problem solving, relationship building, quickly learning, 
empathy, enthusiasm

> * **Liaised** with professor to **communicate** key challenges students faced in course, and made actionable 
 recommendations on approaches that would help based on information **gathered** from office hours

Combine lab rotations or TA classes into one entry with many bullet points

Same stories can be re-framed to match company's values and requirements

Understand your audience, what they care about, the job descriptoin, the nature of the role
  * study similar job descriptions at similar companies -- highlight key skills
  * read company website
  * follow industry trends
  * get familiar with lingo
  * listen to people in job network

## CV vs Resume

### CV

A CV is a complete list

Focuses on research, collaborators, results (publications), teaching

contact, education, dissertation topic, fellowships, awards, research experience,
publications, teaching experience, abstracts and presentations, lectures,
professional affiliations, research grants / funding, certifications

Dissertation committee is great if audience knows who they are.
Otherwise, it dilutes your impact.

Papers often use "This paper does x" -- replace with "I x"

Academic CVs are reviewed over months-long application processes

1 CV can create many resumes

### Resume

Requires: contact, education with relevant coursework, relevant experience, skills

Optional: summary, leadership experience, community engagement, honors/awards, publications

If using publications, consolidate to most relevant + best with (selected/total) on side
> * Presented x articles in refereed journals. Presented research to experts on y 
from around the world at z conferences
> * Effectively communicated research results across subject fields with publication 
in interdisciplinary conference proceedings suitable for broad audience

Industrial resumes are glanced at for 30 seconds or less

### Translation

TA may have 
* planned and organized lessons, provided resources, developed multimedia, 
held office hours, graded papers, answered questions, and met 1-on-1

Convert to transferable skills
* planned, organized, publicly spoke, translated complex concepts, 
used interpersonal skills, managed groups, practiced diplomacy, supervised, thought on my feet

Similarly, PhDs have skills
* interpreted data, analyzed literature, used abstract reasoning, solved problems, 
researched, communicated, synthesized ideas, self-managed, independently executed, 
questioned, expressed complex information simply

Tasks should only be used as **context**, and skills should be highlighted within that context
* Tasks make it easy to imagine your skills being used in a situation

> * Collaborated with 3 chemical engineers and physical chemists from 2 international labs to coordinate 
detailed project update meetings, ensuring strict adherence to research protocols
> * Identified inconsistent humidity levels with lab as confounding factor in multiple research projects, 
and successfully advocated for direct environmental control that enabled 3 new research projects to be completed
> * Independently managed 2 concurrent research projects, and collaborated with a team of 4 researchers in a 
side project, over the past 12 months — resulting in 1 first-author and 1 coauthored paper, and 2 submitted conference presentations

Address typically missing skills in PhD students by digging into non-work activities
* multi-tasking, understanding the real world, money, communicating with non-academics,
responding to heirarchy, leadership, teamwork
* _I could use experience planning/leading group retreat -- coordination, RSVP_
* _I could use experience budgeting, ordering, and setting up $60k of computer equipment_

Use action verbs to create stories related to responsibilities like
* communicator, leader, manager, collaborator, developer, initiator, finisher, 
problem solver, teacher, mentor, advisor, creator, explorer

Avoid deeply specialized terms about research
* extract skills from research and present using STAR method

Think of value you bring -- expertise, skills, standing out
