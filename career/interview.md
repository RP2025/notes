# Interview

## Goal

Researching and networking answers basic questions
  * what the job / field involves
  * skills and knowledge needed
  * what I can bring
  * why I want to work here
  * how people phrase things
  * culture
  * what this company is like

Consulting the job description gives details like key skills and responsibilities

Your resume and cover letter addresses:
  * your skills and knowledge
  * a few stories with their outcomes
  * the connections you bring
  * why you want this job at this company

The interview goes beyond the resume + cover letter to maximize your fit 
and make the best impression -- can they imagine you working here?

Demonstrate that your skills and experiences add value here

Show your thought process, judgement, and emotional intelligence

## Prep

Do EVEN MORE research on the company and role before interviewing
  * Trawl website and social media
    * Find commonalities between posts -- "I found x interesting"
	* Pay attention to company's priorities -- "I want to contribute"
  * Listen to stories and challenges, and language used -- where do they get energized?
  * Find what the employees and company enjoy
  * Figure out further skills
  * Come up with more questions to ask contacts and interviewers
    * Ask about what they haven't shared

Glassdoor is useful for reading about others' interview experiences

Penn alumni network is helpful for expanding your job network into the company
  * Ask them an interview question and note their answer's structure and skills -- reuse 
  their style!
  * "What are some challenges and what skills did you use to overcome them?"

## Question types

Basic questions are guaranteed

Try to guess what other questions will be asked by studying job description

Practice answers out loud

### Who are you

Acts as bridge between small talk and interview

Refreshes interviewer on your background and value

Gives map of diverse experiences and skills

Sets stage for rest of interview

Questions like
  * "Tell me about yourself"
  * "What's your greatest strength / weakness?"
  * "How would your coworkers / boss describe you?"
  * "What will you bring to this role?"


Aim for 1 - 2 minutes, and be confident but not rehearsed

Start with quick "Thank you for your time for this interview", then state your 
name again to get started

❌ Don't get personal -- "I was born in x..."

Be thematic, not literal
> "I've always seen myself as a communicator of science / teacher or mentor / 
analytic person / problem-solver / leader"
> "I've had many experiences doing x"

Explain how theme and experiences match company
> "From whay I understand from the job description and chatting with x, 
it looks like you are doing y. I have a lot of experience in z, a, and b so I 
think I would be a great fit for this position"

Point out specific relevant stories -- STARER is too long here, be quick
  * "My first role was x"
  * "I was instrumental in starting y"
  * "I led a team to do z"

Overlap with other stories is good here

Can answer however you want -- could answer "Here's how I fit in this role" instead

✅ Always include transition to future -- "...and that's why I'm so excited 
to interview for this position, because..."

Conclude with "... and that's why I'm excited about this position, because 
you're looking for someone with x skills / experiences."

✅ Always start with what you bring BEFORE concluding with what you want to gain

### Why?

Questions like
  * "Why work here?"
    * "What do you know about this company?"
  * "Why this job?"
  * "Why are you the best candidate?"
  * "Why should we hire you?"

❌ Don't directly refer back to resume ("as I mentioned in my resume...")

Can go back in time, but connect with more recent experience at the end of the story

Pick stories you're excited about -- have 5-10

Create STARER map of story using bullet point, with associated skills
  * paste on wall behind laptop camera

⚠️  Answer what you gain only AFTER addressing your qualifications above

### Relevant skills

Give me an example of
  * teamwork, leadership, empathy, decision-making
  * curiosity, creativity
  * specific tool
  * when you over-delivered, accomplishment you're proud of
  * analytically identifying problems, working with ambiguity, facts vs intuition
  * making decisions under pressure, altering leadership style
  * bringing about a significant change
  * when something unexpected happened (❗highly likely❗)

Must use a STARER story to answer any of these questions. Addresses not what you 
would do, but what you have done

Focus on 3 - 5 skills / selling points

Tweak a few known stories to adapt as-needed

Define concepts before answering
> * To me, creativity means approaching challenges from many perspectices, 
involving risk in trying something new. A good example is x.
> * I know your organization defines x as y, and I actually think it also involves z.

### Why are you leaving academia?

This question is actually more about why you're applying

This question rarely pops up, because the interviewer also left academia OR the 
interviewer was never in academia so they don't think to ask

Related to
  * "Why do you want this job?"
  * "What aspects of your research are most relevant to this job?"
  * "How does your academic experience translate to this role?"
  * "What parts of the role will be most challenging?"
  * "What are you most concerned about?"
  * "Tell me about your research."

People tend to think in binary -- academia, or not. Academia is not your only 
narrative

On research, give something positive, memorable, meaningful, and accessible

Good answers may touch on:
  * negative experiences in academia (don't harp on it too much, though)
  * didn't live up to expectations
  * it's isolating -- too independent
  * you need something new
  * want a more impactful role, faster pace, higher pay, more teams, 
  choice in location, to add value to work environment, impact on policies
  * you enjoy x more than teaching or research
  * you work well with incentives

Emphasize what you liked and learned
  * pick things that overlap with new job
  * emphasize that you're excited about the new role
  * highlight what you learned about yourself and other fields (I want 
  to continue to do x)
    * I liked being creative / working independently / pushing new boundaries / 
  gaining a deep knowledge / developing strong communication skills / building 
  resilience and perserverance / learning quickly
    * I learned through my alumni network that you do x, y, and z. I got excited 
	about how important those are to this role at your company
	* My degree gave me great transferable skills

### Negative questions

E.g., "Tell me about a time when things went wrong"

❌ Don't: 
* explain everything that went wrong, how you really felt, or unethical behavior
* list anything in the job description as a weakness

✅ Do: 
* Demonstrate that you've faced challenges similar to those that may 
appear in this role. 
* Show how and why you chose your approach
* Highlight what you could have done differently
* State what you learned
  * "After this project, I thought about what could've been done differently"
  * "I didn't enjoy this experience, but I learned something"
* Show how you applied the lesson
  * "Actually, I faced a similar situation recently. But this time..."
  * "I'm glad I spend some time learning x after that situation because I've been 
  able to use..."


1. Tell a short failure STARER story from long ago (e.g. "at the beginning of my x") to give 
yourself time to grow and learn.
2. State lesson
3. Follow up with longer success STARER story from more recently

#### Examples
Teamwork
1. Failure: no buy-in from team
2. Lesson: need feedback early in project
3. Success: led team to identify plan early

Communication
1. Failure: didn't adopt narrative to audience, so they were confused
2. Lesson: learn about audience and their background before speaking
3. Success: recently presented at industry conference and got great feedback

Leadership
1. Failure: didn't celebrate success before moving on to next project
2. Lesson: received great feedback from mentor about investing in people
3. Success: took team retreat and highlighted successes and shared with senior leadership

Easy weaknesses are public speaking (then practicing at conferences/as a TA), 
being overly generous with you time (then delegating and supervising)

### Special questions

Q: "Do you have questions for us" 

A: Must have questions ready.
E.g. "What are some example projects for a starter in this role?" 
"What does a good first 6-12 months look like?" 
"Are there opportunities for training and mentoring?" 
"What are the next steps for interviewing?"

A: use short STARER story from long ago (e.g., "at the beginning of my x") 
to give yourself room to grow and learn. Then state Then use longer STARER story to 
show success.

Q: "What salary do you expect?"

A: Not sure how to answer this yet. 
"I expect fair compensation in line with the industry average for this role."

Q: "Are you interviewing elsewhere"

A: Not sure how to answer this yet.
"I am interviewing at similar companies in this field, like x, y, and z"

Q: "What parts of the role will be most challenging?"

A: "Well, I've never learned specifically about x so that will be tough, but I've 
learned quickly before how to do x, y, and z during my PhD."

## STARER stories

S - situation - when/who/what was project and goal. 
Clear and concise with key details for proper context. 
Clarify my role and define terms/abbreviations.

T - task / challenge - why is it challenging and hard, what obstacles were faced, 
why is it exciting? Build drama

A - action - what did YOU do and what skills were used. 
Why did you take this approach? Showcase relevant skills.

R - result - outcome, what was learned, how successful, how did it affect 
overall project?

E - emotions - How did you feel? What was interesting or exciting? 
How do you approach new things?

R - relevance - How is this relevant to role?

Most time should be spent on Action, but NEVER skip other steps

## After the interview

Send thank-you note 3 - 24 hours later
> Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. 
I enjoyed meeting the team and learning more about the role, and that you’re 
looking for someone who can do X. I was very happy to discuss Y project 
as it’s really interesting to me, and closely connected to my Z project. I 
look forward to the opportunity to speak again. Have a great weekend.

## Tips

Have plan B ready for Zoom call, like phone

Research specific interviewer beforehand to come up with targeted questions

Setup:
  * Use a fixed chair to avoid nervously swiveling
  * Align camera with eyes at 2/3 mark
  * Bring camera to eye-level
  * Look directly at camera

Get to story-telling ASAP if nervous

❌ Avoid "umm, well, I think"

✅ Replace with "That's a great question", "Let me think of a good example to illustrate", 
"Yes, I was considering that before our interview", "To me, x means y"
