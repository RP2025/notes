# Network

## General process

1. Perform independent research on career using Vault Guides, Glassdoor, etc.
  * Why do I want to work in this field?
2. Start somewhere. No need to be perfect!
  * Collect sample questions from Aurora, noting how conversations started and ended, 
  and thinking about key takeaways
3. Organize specific questions in a spreadsheet -- important because I'm not in 
exploration phase anymore
4. Reach out to low-hanging fruit = friends, family, Penn alumni, student groups
5. (Optional) Network with a buddy to stay accountable and share information
6. Reach out to next level of people, on LunchClub e.g.
7. Perform passive networking by sharing and commenting on social media posts
8. Make the plunge into in-person networking
  1. Rehearse greeting, practice intro
  2. Can help organize events to get thrown into the deep end
  3. Use group settings to set up 1:1 meetings later
  4. Always ask questions at info sessions and panel discussions
    * Introduce yourself before question -- "I'm James Glazar, a PhD student 
	applying computational methods to study chromatin organization..."
  5. Follow up with speakers

Create a list of interesting companies and engage with alumni and recruiters

Example spreadsheet may have: company, position, knowledge, salary, contacts in network, 
advice received, last follow-up date, new contacts suggested

Leverage connections during applications

Ask people questions specific to their experiences, job positions, and skills

Encourage the other person that you're competent and worth their time

Ask those close to you:
* What is my expertise? 
* What makes me stand out? 
* Positive words used by others to describe me 
* Why am I seeded out for help? 
* How I’ve made a difference? 
* How others have benefitted?

Then create a list of your keywords

## Elevator pitch

Short description of skills, interests, and goals and why they are productive 
and beneficial to some company

Highlights what makes you stand out and what you're proud of

Address:
1. Who you are
2. What you do
3. How you do it
4. Why you do it

✅ Identify why you are relevant and valuable and make a memorable 1st impression

State career goals, how you want to make a difference, and what you want to achieve

Can use words from others to boost this image
  * How do others describe you? 
  * How do you make others feel?

❌ You are NOT just a PhD student

✅ Pick a theme for your work and the problems you solve

> Hi, I'm James, James Glazar. I am working to discover how our own cells can be 
reprogrammed to fight cancer by combining innovative computational approaches with 
an exciting international collaboration with labs in 3 different scientific 
disciplines. Most of my PhD research is done here at Penn Engineering.

> I was recently in x helping our collaborators do y, and I really enjoyed z. 
We will be sharing our solutions in a new paper in the next few months

> I saw from your LinkedIn profile that you have experience in x, and I would 
love to hear about your research there as compared to y. Did you see any z?

❌ Don't monologue for minutes on end -- keep it to 30 seconds or less

Test different pitches and practice to sound natural

Note differences between introverts and extroverts:
  * Introverts -- easily socially drained, spend much time thinking, prefer 
  quiet independent work, think before communicating, observant, effectively 
  communicate and listen
  * Extroverts -- socially energized, make conversations look easy, love 
  brainstorming in real time, work in teams, can be un-strategic communicator and 
  poor listener

## Informational interviews

Form network of professionals to gather information about field / company / job

✅ Actively network even when not looking for a job 

Helps develop understanding of lingo / acronyms

Find emails on MyPenn and CareerShift, then reach out with [email](#email)

Start conversation by asking how they're doing, and thank them for their time

Listen actively and keep notes in a spreadsheet

Share appropriately -- your motivations, interests, experiences, skills

Ask open-ended questions about their experiences and opinions (not yes/no)

✅ Always ask for a referral to other people they know at the end of the chat

Send a thank-you note to the interviewee and person who connected you (if applicable) 
within 24 hours

Send LinkedIn connect request WITH PERSONAL NOTE

Foster professional relationship by sharing personal news and relevant articles

### Email networking <a name="email"></a>

Understand career decisions and experiences of people with similar backgrounds

Demonstrate you care about them and their perspective by asking questions specific to 
them and their industry / company / job

❌ Don't email on Friday / weekends, in September for faculty, during earnings for finance

  * Why you're writing
  * How you're connected
    * school, friend, subject, awards, sports/hobbies, student groups, advisor, 
	employer, posts / articles shared on LinkedIn
  * Why them in particular
    * e.g., "I see your company is doing x, and I'm curious about how that's 
	impacted your position"
  * What you want

	or give you a quick call at your convenience?"
  * Why it's helpful to you
  * What are the next steps
  * Express gratitude

Subject line should be 5 - 10 words
  * "Can you share your industry insights with a fellow science PhD?"
  * "Quick question from Penn PhD student about finance"
  * "NAME suggested I reach out to you"

Follow up after a few weeks -- MAX 2 times
> I was hoping to reach out with a couple of questions about your current role. 
I am graduating from Penn next year, and hearing from a Penn alum in this 
field would be very helpful. I have copied my original email below and hope to 
hear from you soon. If a phone call is easier, I am free x, but can make myself 
available at a time that works best for you. I would be delighted to set up 
a time to chat briefly with you. 

If successfully scheduled interview, send a reminder the day before

Learn about their decision making process

## Online platforms

Commit to manageable number of platforms and keep them updated 

Build consistent personal brand between online platforms, cover letter, and resume

Personal brand = what others say and think about you in your absence

Keep primary audience in mind with each post and edit

Use energetic language like "passion", "excited", and "satisfying"

Communicate through many media -- written, images, videos

### Aurora 

Interviews with former PhD students now in industry

Consider what questions were asked and how they were answered
  * What questions remain open? How can you follow up?

### Handshake

Find and connect with students like you

Cannot filter by degree type, but can filter with keywords

Ask for informational interviews (esp. from former / current interns)

See if others have heard anything about a company / field

Connect with recruiters

### LinkedIn

Use Penn alumni search on LinkedIn and filter by region, industry, company, skills, etc.

Focus on secondary connections, and perhaps ask for your connection to introduce you

Study how people employed at a company have weaved their career path to/from the company

✅ Pronounce name, upload short elevator pitch, customize URL, set background

❌ Avoid generic headlines -- use engaging description instead
  * "PhD Student passionate about computation, data, and teaching"
  * "Seeking to design new computational approaches to unlock DNA architecture"

The `About` section is how people understand and appreciate your 
diverse experiences. Connect this section with your skills listed below.

Help reader take away 3 - 5 key points about you

Link books, blog posts, publications to keep profile fresh

### CareerShift
