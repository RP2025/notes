# Corporate accounting mini-course by Damodaran

## Financial statements overview

Accountants check transactions and operations in real-time.
  * No forecasting or valuation
  * Track ownership, spending, debt, profit
  * There are formal standard rules, like GAAP and IFRS

All 3 financial statements are interconnected
  * E.g., depreciation/amortization on income statement (-) is added 
  back on cash flow statement (+)

## Income statements

Income statement is business earnings in some period, broken down 
by revenues and expenses
  * Revenues - cost of goods sold (production costs) = gross profit 
  (production profitability)
  * Gross profit - other operating expenses (sales, admin) = operating 
  profit (profitability of business)
  * Operating profit - financial expenses (non-equity financing, debt) = 
  taxable income 
  * Taxable income - taxes = net income

Accounting types:
  * Accrual accounting records transactions when they occur, not when 
  cash flow occurs (common)
  * Cash accounting records revenues/expenses when paid (rare).

Expense types:
  * Operating expenses include production/servicing (COGS), and
  selling/general/admin (SGA, can be kinda amorphous) expenses
  * Financing expenses include non-equity financing, generally interest 
  on debt and corporate bonds. Also can include leases.
    * Sometimes netted against earned interest (incl cash/marketable 
	securities like T-bills) and only tallied as net.
  * Capital expenses include equipment, real estate, or more abstract 
  property. These provide benefits over many years.
    * Economic depreciation is pure value depreciation, accounting 
	depreciation uses some ruleset, tax depreciation is strategic way 
	to save on taxes

Revenues
  * Products sold over many years (software or construction, e.g.) 
  must have revenues split over those years as deferred revenues.
  * Must break down by geographic region and business segment
  * See footnotes for breakdowns

Cross-holdings in other companies
  * Minority stake -- just report income on income statement
  * Majority stake -- consider 100% of subsidiary's revenues, operating 
  expenses, and operating income as your own

Extraordinary = one-time only, like lawsuit or big sale

Pro-forma accounting breaks rules, but to customize accounting reports 
to business model.
  * 🕵️ Be suspicious of moving expenses from operating to capital or 
  the removal of extraordinary expenses.

### Problems

1. 3-year service contract for $150M at fiscal year start, paid 50% 
up front and 50% in 2 years. 
  * Accrual accounting shows $50M this year, as it's evenly spread out
2. Cost of goods sold and other operating expenses include:
  * COGS: materials, labor, maintenance; Other: SGA
3. Company with low COGS, high SGA, and lots of debt would have:
  * High gross profit, low operating profit, very low net profit
4. A 5% minority stake in another company appears in:
  * Your company's net profits, below operating income line
5. Extraordinary expenses:
  * Appear infrequently and without regularity

### Examples

Peloton -- young company
  * Revenues grow rapidly
  * Gross profits look healthy
  * Net income is negative
  * High RnD, weirdly included as operating expense

Netflix -- growth company
  * Lower growth rate
  * High RnD cost, correctly included as cost of revenues (operating 
  expense, essential to business)
  * Net income is positive
  * Foreign exchange costs included as extraordinary, but happen every 
  year

Coca Cola -- mature company
  * Revenues are constant
  * SGA is main expense (marketing), COGS is small
  * Large equity income included in taxable income 
  * High net income
  * Weird combination of geographical + business breakdowns

Toyota -- aging company
  * Revenues are dropping
  * Financing operation inside Toyota
  * Large equity income

Special sector-specific line items:
  * Commodity -- costs of exploring and extracting, excise taxes
  * Financial services -- ambiguity of revenues and debt. Just focus 
  on equity income. Goodwill is admission of past errors
  * Pharma -- biggest expense is RnD expense which should be capital 
  but is often called operating.


### Problems

1. COGS as % of revenue for Navistar, Nordstrom, and Google
  * 85%, 65%, 45%. Navistar is manufacturing so high makes sense, and 
  Google is tech so low makes sense. Could also be due to Navistar having 
  high depreciation cost.
2. SGA as % of total operating expense
  * 10%, 30%, 20%. Nordstrom needs many salespeople, while a manufacturer 
  has a few consistent clients. Roughly acts as "economy-of-scale" 
  metric, where higher is better.
3. What is Navistar's financing revenues/expenses
  * They issue payment plans for large purchases
4. Taxes represent:
  * Taxes on taxable income in the tax books, based on tax code
5. Navistar has currency exchange loss, but Google has gain. How?
  * Navistar perhaps dealt with developing country with depreciating 
  FX, while Google dealt with developed countries with appreciating FX.
  * Revenues from non-US but costs in US --> worse dollar is good. 
  Revenues from US but costs in non-US --> worse dollar is bad.

## Balance sheet

Reflects cumulative company history, but different new practices lead  
to a messy interpretation.

Balance sheet summarizes ownership and debt, plus estimate of equity 
value.
  * Fixed assets (long-term), current assets (short-term), financial 
  assets (investments), intangible assets (nonphysical things like brand)
  * Debt (long-term), current liabilities (short-term), other 
  liabilities, equity (of shareholders)

Schools of thought on balance sheet purpose:
  * Records capital invested into assets-in-place (which allow for 
  operations)
  * Measures current value of firm
  * Measures value upon liquidation

Fixed and current assets
  * Old way -- original cost - accounting depreciation
  * New way -- current market value
  * Difference is bigger for older and fixed assets.

Financial assets
  * Securities, partial ownership of other companies
  * When owning public shares, use current market price
  * Majority stake -- 100% of subsidiary's revenues and operating income 
  is included, but portion not owned is minority or non-controlling 
  interest
  * Minority stake -- just show as asset. Short-term (trading) is marked 
  to market. Long-term (investing) is show at book value.

Intangible assets
  * Basically totally fictional. Cannot get accurate measure of brand 
  name value, e.g.
  * Goodwill is acquistion's price - book value. Tends to be lagged 
  and useless.

Current liabilities
  * Non-interest-bearing -- accounts payable, supplier credit
  * Interest-bearing short-term -- commercial paper, short-term debt, 
  short-term portions of long-term debt. Don't consider when calculating 
  non-cash working capital debt.
  * Deferred salaries and taxes

Debt due
  * Corporate bonds, bank loans, lease debt (standard from 2019+)
  * Generally not marked-to-market. Recorded as originally borrowed.

Footnotes
  * Due dates, fixed-rate/floating-rate

Shareholder's equity/book value -- kinda useless
  * Old way -- Equity to start business plus cumulative augmentations 
  and retained earnings
  * New way -- Jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting
  * Generally not good metric of intrisic equity value. 
  * Par value (historic, ignore), company age (older is higher), 
  capitalization effects (only capitalized expenses are assets), 
  buybacks (reduce shareholder equity), negative equity (can happen 
  if large buyback or negative income)

### Problems

1. Conventional accounting records fixed assets:
  * at original cost minus aging costs. inflation not considered.
2. When a company owns 10% of another company, it's recorded on the 
balance sheet at:
  * book value of 10%, but if trading then market value of 10%
3. When a company owns 60% of another company, it's recorded on the 
balance sheet at:
  * book value for 100% of assets, with liability for 40%
4. Goodwill:
  * measures premium paid over book value to acquire a company
5. Book value (shareholder's equity) is closest to market/intrinstic 
value for:
  * mature companies with significant physical assets that can be 
  objectively accounted for.

### Examples

Peloton -- young company
  * Small but fast-growing assets
  * Negative shareholder's equity bc company has been losing money
  * Biggest single asset is cash/marketable securities
  * Future growth is not accounted for on balance sheet

Netflix -- growth company
  * Biggest single asset is non-current content (IP)
  * Big liability is deferred revenue from revenue accounted for, 
  but services not yet provided (subscriptions)
  * Common stock par value (useless)

Coca Cola -- mature company
  * Huge asset base with little growth
  * High equity method invesements (holdings in other companies)
  * Deferred income tax assets -- positive means they overpaid before and 
  can pay less in the future
  * Goodwill is basically useless, but indicates some acquisitions 
  occurred
  * Treasury stock from buybacks, which can be reissued. Buyback shares 
  can also be destroyed. If held under treasury stock, it reduces 
  shareholder equity.
  * Also provides breakdown of debt in footnotes.

Toyota -- aging company
  * Total assets with zero growth
  * Finance receivables and affiliated companies (like financial assets)
  * Accrued pension/severance liabilites is unique to Japan
  * Deferred taxes as liability -- underpaid before and owe taxes later

Special sector-specific line items
  * Tangible vs intangible value
  * Goodwill for acquisitive companies
  * Commodity -- inventories can lose value, FX adjustments can show up 
  in income statement or balance sheet.
  * Financial services -- easy to get market values, non-controlling 
  portion of companies shows up as liability
  * Pharma -- biggest intangible (IP) is not found on balance sheet

### Problems

1. Net property/plant/equipment (100% - cumulative depreciation) as % 
of gross property/plant/equipment for Navistar, Nordstrom, and Google
  * 35%, 45%, 75%. Makes sense that heavy machines depreciate quickly 
  due to wear and tear and old companies have longer to depreciate.
2. Calculate working capital = current assets - current liabilities. 
How to make definition more meaningful?
  * 1800, -290, 107230. Most of Google's working capital is short-term 
  investments, whereas Nordstrom has little cash. Google must need lots 
  of working capital. Better metric nets out non-debt current liabilites 
  from non-cash current assets (ignore debt and cash...why?). My idea 
  for a better metric is the ratio of assets/liabilities to get sense 
  of how indebted a company is.
3. Navistar has negative shareholder/common equity because of:
  * their big losses in prior years (negative retained earnings), 
  overpaying dividends, stock buybacks, extraordinary charges, or 
  major restructuring
4. Google $20.6B goodwill reflects:
  * their significant acquisition above book value.
5. Navistar has a significant pension liability, which measures:
  * underfunded pension and post-retirement obligations
  * if pensionfound in both assets and liabilities, then assets 
  represents pension fund and liabilities represents total due.

## Cash flow statement

Cash flow statement is cash inflow and outflow in some period. 
  * Most "honest" accounting statement 
  * Cash flows from operations (after taxes + interest expenses)
  * Cash flows from investing (incl divestiture, acquisitions/cap ex, 
  disposal/purchase of financial assets)
  * Cash flows from financing (issues/repurchase of equity, issue/
  repayment of debt, dividend payment)
  * Sum = net change in cash balance 

Cash flows from operations
  * Start with net income from income statement
  * Add back depreciation/amortization and non-cash expenses
  * Add or subtract changes in accounts receivable, inventory, 
  other current assets/liabilities, accounts payable, and taxes due.
  * This captures change in non-cash working capital (= non-cash 
  current assets - non-debt current liabilities), which correlates 
  negatively with cash flows (ties up cash).

Cash flows from investing
  * Investments in operating assets -- -capex, +divestitures of assets, 
  -cash acquisitions (divestitures = selling old equipment, e.g.)
    * Drives growth in revenue/operating income
  * Investments in non-operating assets -- -financial assets, 
  -non-operating assets, +divestitures of securities

Cash flows from financing
  * Net cash from/to debt -- +debt raised, -debt repaid
  * Net cash from/to equity -- +new equity issuances, -dividends paid, 
  -stock buybacks
    * 1980s saw introduction of buybacks. Those who sell back gain cash, 
	and those who don't gain bigger equity slice.
  * Note that interest expenses are already accounted for in net income

Cash flows can predict free cash flow to equity = possible dividend
  * Start with cash flows from operations
  * Add investments in operating assets (see Investing above)
  * Add net case from/to debt (see Financing above)

### Problems

1. To get operating cash flows:
  * Take net income and add back depr./amort. and other non-cash charges
2. After that, consider:
  * Increasing inventory decreases CF and increasing accounts payable 
  increases CF
3. Acquisitions may be made with cash, stock, or mix. What shows up 
under investing activities?
  * Cash-based acquisitions and the cash portion of mixed acquisitions
4. Dividends can be cash or stock. Buybacks can be kept as treasury 
stock or destroyed. What shows up under financing?
  * Cash dividends and all buybacks
5. Cash flows for young, high-growth companies have:
  * Negative operations, negative investing, positive financing
