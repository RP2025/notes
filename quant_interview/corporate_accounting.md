# Corporate accounting mini-course by Damodaran

## Financial statements overview

Accountants check transactions and operations in real-time.
  * No forecasting or valuation
  * Track ownership, spending, debt, profit
  * There are formal standard rules, like GAAP and IFRS

All 3 financial statements are interconnected
  * E.g., depreciation/amortization on income statement (-) is added 
  back on cash flow statement (+)

## Income statements

Income statement is business earnings in some period, broken down 
by revenues and expenses
  * Revenues - cost of goods sold (production costs) = gross profit 
  (production profitability)
  * Gross profit - other operating expenses (sales, admin) = operating 
  profit (profitability of business)
  * Operating profit - financial expenses (non-equity financing, debt) = 
  taxable income 
  * Taxable income - taxes = net income

Accounting types:
  * Accrual accounting records transactions when they occur, not when 
  cash flow occurs (common)
  * Cash accounting records revenues/expenses when paid (rare).

Expense types:
  * Operating expenses include production/servicing (COGS), and
  selling/general/admin (SGA, can be kinda amorphous) expenses
  * Financing expenses include non-equity financing, generally interest 
  on debt and corporate bonds. Also can include leases.
    * Sometimes netted against earned interest (incl cash/marketable 
	securities like T-bills) and only tallied as net.
  * Capital expenses include equipment, real estate, or more abstract 
  property. These provide benefits over many years.
    * Economic depreciation is pure value depreciation, accounting 
	depreciation uses some ruleset, tax depreciation is strategic way 
	to save on taxes

Revenues
  * Products sold over many years (software or construction, e.g.) 
  must have revenues split over those years as deferred revenues.
  * Must break down by geographic region and business segment
  * See footnotes for breakdowns

Cross-holdings in other companies
  * Minority stake -- just report income on income statement
  * Majority stake -- consider 100% of subsidiary's revenues, operating 
  expenses, and operating income as your own

Extraordinary = one-time only, like lawsuit or big sale

Pro-forma accounting breaks rules, but to customize accounting reports 
to business model.
  * 🕵️ Be suspicious of moving expenses from operating to capital or 
  the removal of extraordinary expenses.

### Problems

1. 3-year service contract for $150M at fiscal year start, paid 50% 
up front and 50% in 2 years. 
  * Accrual accounting shows $50M this year, as it's evenly spread out
2. Cost of goods sold and other operating expenses include:
  * COGS: materials, labor, maintenance; Other: SGA
3. Company with low COGS, high SGA, and lots of debt would have:
  * High gross profit, low operating profit, very low net profit
4. A 5% minority stake in another company appears in:
  * Your company's net profits, below operating income line
5. Extraordinary expenses:
  * Appear infrequently and without regularity

### Examples

Peloton -- young company
  * Revenues grow rapidly
  * Gross profits look healthy
  * Net income is negative
  * High RnD, weirdly included as operating expense

Netflix -- growth company
  * Lower growth rate
  * High RnD cost, correctly included as cost of revenues (operating 
  expense, essential to business)
  * Net income is positive
  * Foreign exchange costs included as extraordinary, but happen every 
  year

Coca Cola -- mature company
  * Revenues are constant
  * SGA is main expense (marketing), COGS is small
  * Large equity income included in taxable income 
  * High net income
  * Weird combination of geographical + business breakdowns

Toyota -- aging company
  * Revenues are dropping
  * Financing operation inside Toyota
  * Large equity income

Special sector-specific line items:
  * Commodity -- costs of exploring and extracting, excise taxes
  * Financial services -- ambiguity of revenues and debt. Just focus 
  on equity income. Goodwill is admission of past errors
  * Pharma -- biggest expense is RnD expense which should be capital 
  but is often called operating.


### Problems

1. COGS as % of revenue for Navistar, Nordstrom, and Google
  * 85%, 65%, 45%. Navistar is manufacturing so high makes sense, and 
  Google is tech so low makes sense. Could also be due to Navistar having 
  high depreciation cost.
2. SGA as % of total operating expense
  * 10%, 30%, 20%. Nordstrom needs many salespeople, while a manufacturer 
  has a few consistent clients. Roughly acts as "economy-of-scale" 
  metric, where higher is better.
3. What is Navistar's financing revenues/expenses
  * They issue payment plans for large purchases
4. Taxes represent:
  * Taxes on taxable income in the tax books, based on tax code
5. Navistar has currency exchange loss, but Google has gain. How?
  * Navistar perhaps dealt with developing country with depreciating 
  FX, while Google dealt with developed countries with appreciating FX.
  * Revenues from non-US but costs in US --> worse dollar is good. 
  Revenues from US but costs in non-US --> worse dollar is bad.

## Balance sheet

Reflects cumulative company history, but different new practices lead  
to a messy interpretation.

Balance sheet summarizes ownership and debt, plus estimate of equity 
value.
  * Fixed assets (long-term), current assets (short-term), financial 
  assets (investments), intangible assets (nonphysical things like brand)
  * Debt (long-term), current liabilities (short-term), other 
  liabilities, equity (of shareholders)

Schools of thought on balance sheet purpose:
  * Records capital invested into assets-in-place (which allow for 
  operations)
  * Measures current value of firm
  * Measures value upon liquidation

Fixed and current assets
  * Old way -- original cost - accounting depreciation
  * New way -- current market value
  * Difference is bigger for older and fixed assets.

Financial assets
  * Securities, partial ownership of other companies
  * When owning public shares, use current market price
  * Majority stake -- 100% of subsidiary's revenues and operating income 
  is included, but portion not owned is minority or non-controlling 
  interest
  * Minority stake -- just show as asset. Short-term (trading) is marked 
  to market. Long-term (investing) is show at book value.

Intangible assets
  * Basically totally fictional. Cannot get accurate measure of brand 
  name value, e.g.
  * Goodwill is acquistion's price - book value. Tends to be lagged 
  and useless.

Current liabilities
  * Non-interest-bearing -- accounts payable, supplier credit
  * Interest-bearing short-term -- commercial paper, short-term debt, 
  short-term portions of long-term debt. Don't consider when calculating 
  non-cash working capital debt.
  * Deferred salaries and taxes

Debt due
  * Corporate bonds, bank loans, lease debt (standard from 2019+)
  * Generally not marked-to-market. Recorded as originally borrowed.

Footnotes
  * Due dates, fixed-rate/floating-rate

Shareholder's equity/book value -- kinda useless
  * Old way -- Equity to start business plus cumulative augmentations 
  and retained earnings
  * New way -- Jumbled mess of mark-to-market accounting
  * Generally not good metric of intrisic equity value. 
  * Par value (historic, ignore), company age (older is higher), 
  capitalization effects (only capitalized expenses are assets), 
  buybacks (reduce shareholder equity), negative equity (can happen 
  if large buyback or negative income)

### Problems

1. Conventional accounting records fixed assets:
  * at original cost minus aging costs. inflation not considered.
2. When a company owns 10% of another company, it's recorded on the 
balance sheet at:
  * book value of 10%, but if trading then market value of 10%
3. When a company owns 60% of another company, it's recorded on the 
balance sheet at:
  * book value for 100% of assets, with liability for 40%
4. Goodwill:
  * measures premium paid over book value to acquire a company
5. Book value (shareholder's equity) is closest to market/intrinstic 
value for:
  * mature companies with significant physical assets that can be 
  objectively accounted for.

### Examples

Peloton -- young company
  * Small but fast-growing assets
  * Negative shareholder's equity bc company has been losing money
  * Biggest single asset is cash/marketable securities
  * Future growth is not accounted for on balance sheet

Netflix -- growth company
  * Biggest single asset is non-current content (IP)
  * Big liability is deferred revenue from revenue accounted for, 
  but services not yet provided (subscriptions)
  * Common stock par value (useless)

Coca Cola -- mature company
  * Huge asset base with little growth
  * High equity method invesements (holdings in other companies)
  * Deferred income tax assets -- positive means they overpaid before and 
  can pay less in the future
  * Goodwill is basically useless, but indicates some acquisitions 
  occurred
  * Treasury stock from buybacks, which can be reissued. Buyback shares 
  can also be destroyed. If held under treasury stock, it reduces 
  shareholder equity.
  * Also provides breakdown of debt in footnotes.

Toyota -- aging company
  * Total assets with zero growth
  * Finance receivables and affiliated companies (like financial assets)
  * Accrued pension/severance liabilites is unique to Japan
  * Deferred taxes as liability -- underpaid before and owe taxes later

Special sector-specific line items
  * Tangible vs intangible value
  * Goodwill for acquisitive companies
  * Commodity -- inventories can lose value, FX adjustments can show up 
  in income statement or balance sheet.
  * Financial services -- easy to get market values, non-controlling 
  portion of companies shows up as liability
  * Pharma -- biggest intangible (IP) is not found on balance sheet

### Problems

1. Net property/plant/equipment (100% - cumulative depreciation) as % 
of gross property/plant/equipment for Navistar, Nordstrom, and Google
  * 35%, 45%, 75%. Makes sense that heavy machines depreciate quickly 
  due to wear and tear and old companies have longer to depreciate.
2. Calculate working capital = current assets - current liabilities. 
How to make definition more meaningful?
  * 1800, -290, 107230. Most of Google's working capital is short-term 
  investments, whereas Nordstrom has little cash. Google must need lots 
  of working capital. Better metric nets out non-debt current liabilites 
  from non-cash current assets (ignore debt and cash...why?). My idea 
  for a better metric is the ratio of assets/liabilities to get sense 
  of how indebted a company is.
3. Navistar has negative shareholder/common equity because of:
  * their big losses in prior years (negative retained earnings), 
  overpaying dividends, stock buybacks, extraordinary charges, or 
  major restructuring
4. Google $20.6B goodwill reflects:
  * their significant acquisition above book value.
5. Navistar has a significant pension liability, which measures:
  * underfunded pension and post-retirement obligations
  * if pensionfound in both assets and liabilities, then assets 
  represents pension fund and liabilities represents total due.

## Cash flow statement

Cash flow statement is cash inflow and outflow in some period. 
  * Most "honest" accounting statement 
  * Cash flows from operations (after taxes + interest expenses)
  * Cash flows from investing (incl divestiture, acquisitions/cap ex, 
  disposal/purchase of financial assets)
  * Cash flows from financing (issues/repurchase of equity, issue/
  repayment of debt, dividend payment)
  * Sum = net change in cash balance 

Cash flows from operations
  * Start with net income from income statement
  * Add back depreciation/amortization and non-cash expenses
  * Add or subtract changes in accounts receivable, inventory, 
  other current assets/liabilities, accounts payable, and taxes due.
  * This captures change in non-cash working capital (= non-cash 
  current assets - non-debt current liabilities), which correlates 
  negatively with cash flows (ties up cash).

Cash flows from investing
  * Investments in operating assets -- -capex, +divestitures of assets, 
  -cash acquisitions (divestitures = selling old equipment, e.g.)
    * Drives growth in revenue/operating income
  * Investments in non-operating assets -- -financial assets, 
  -non-operating assets, +divestitures of securities
  * Optimistic companies should be investing more

Cash flows from financing
  * Net cash from/to debt -- +debt raised, -debt repaid
  * Net cash from/to equity -- +new equity issuances, -dividends paid, 
  -stock buybacks
    * 1980s saw introduction of buybacks. Those who sell back gain cash, 
	and those who don't gain bigger equity slice.
  * Note that interest expenses are already accounted for in net income

Cash flows can predict free cash flow to equity = possible dividend
  * Start with cash flows from operations
  * Add investments in operating assets (see Investing above)
  * Add net case from/to debt (see Financing above)

Definitions (correct?)
  * Non-cash working capital -- accounts receivable, inventories, 
  accounts payable, unearned revenue 
  * Operating assets -- cap ex, sale of property/plants/equipment, 
  cash acquisitions, divestitures, sale (purchase) of intangible 
  assets
  * Non-operating assets -- investments in marketable and equity 
  securities, net decrease (increase) in loans sold, other investing 
  activities
  * Buybacks -- issuance and repurchase of common stock

### Problems

1. To get operating cash flows:
  * Take net income and add back depr./amort. and other non-cash charges
2. After that, consider:
  * Increasing inventory decreases CF and increasing accounts payable 
  increases CF
3. Acquisitions may be made with cash, stock, or mix. What shows up 
under investing activities?
  * Cash-based acquisitions and the cash portion of mixed acquisitions
4. Dividends can be cash or stock. Buybacks can be kept as treasury 
stock or destroyed. What shows up under financing?
  * Cash dividends and all buybacks
5. Cash flows for young, high-growth companies have:
  * Negative operations, negative investing, positive financing

### Examples

Peloton -- young company
  * Negative operating / investing CF
  * Financing CF positive via issuing stock
  * Stock-based compensation is big part of CF

Netflix -- growth company
  * Negative operating CF due to large content spend
  * Little investing activities
  * Using debt in financing CF

Coca Cola -- mature company
  * Stock-based compensation is small part of CF
  * Lots of operation-related and non-op-related investments
  * Debt payment and issuances are close 

Toyota -- aging company
  * Deferred income taxes
  * Dividends

Special sector-specific line items
  * Not super relevant for CF statement
  * Oil has lots of depreciation, so CF can be positive
  * Financial services have opaque CF statements, many line items
  * Pharma hides RnD expenses, little other investing activities.

### Problems

1. Estimate change in operating CF from changes in non-cash working 
capital for Navistar, Nordstrom, and Google
  * Changes in accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, 
  unearned revenue yields -6, 210, and -1662, compared to total 
  operating CF of 522, 1236, and 55337. Navistar and Google 
  have mostly cash, while Nordstrom deals with inventory/non-cash assets.
2. Why add back stock-based compensation under operating CF?
  * Because stock-based comp. is an accounting expense but not cash.
3. Estimate investment in operating and non-operating assets based on 
investing CF
  * Operating assets = cap ex, sale of property, cash acquisitions, 
  divestitures, and sale of intangible assets yields -234, -935, 
  -26803 vs overall investing CFs of -194, -909, -23943. 
  Most of each company's investing is capex
4. Estimate change in total debt based on financing CF
  * +188, +7, -276. Navistar and Nordstrom are taking on debt while 
  Google is paying off debt.
5. Estimate dividends and stock buybacks
  * 5/0, 198/229, 0/27142. Google is taking big buybacks to pay back 
  shareholders.

## Accounting inconsistencies

The market prices all these in, even if accountants don't.

Taxes
  * Marginal tax rate -- found in tax codes. Typically, 20-25%, but 
  taxes are based on where the income is made (international)
  * Effective tax rate -- found in accrual-based accounting sheets. 
  Simply calculate taxes / taxable income. Typically lower than 
  marginal tax rate due to tax deferral and avoidance.
  * Cash tax rate -- taxes actually paid on taxable income.
  * Deferred taxes -- difference between expensed and reported 
  taxes.
  * Can carry losses forwards or backwards to avoid taxes

Stock-based compensation
  * Got big in 1990s bc companies didn't have cash
  * Ideally, aligns interests of employees w shareholders
  * Can be in form of options to buy at fixed price later, or shares
  * Should be considered a compensation expense and be valued at 
  time granted
  * Question: consider as non-cash expense (like depreciation)? 
  Practitioners say yes, Damodoran says no bc it's basically cash.

Leases are debt
  * Accountants consider capital leases (effective ownership) and 
  operating leases (ability to use) separately. Capital lease is treated 
  as debt and operating lease is treated as operating expense.
  * All leases considered debt, starting in 2019
  * Convert leases to debt by calculating NPV of lease commitments 
  using pre-tax cost of debt as discount rate. Pre-tax cost of 
  debt is based on default risk.
    * Also compute interest expenses (=NPV of lease * pre-tax cost 
	of debt) and depreciation of item (computed using life of lease 
	and some depreciation method). 
  * Similar examples include purchase commitments (for manufacturing 
  firms), content commitments (streaming/media companies), player 
  contracts (sports teams)

RnD is cap ex (investment for the future)
  * Currently considered an expense because benefits are uncertain
  * However, other cap ex is also uncertain (new factory, e.g.)
  * This takes the asset of RnD off the balance sheet!
  * To capitalize RnD: 
    1. Estimate amortizable life (how long to pay off)
	2. Collect RnD expenses as far back as amortizable life
	3. Estimate amortized and unamortized RnD for each year.
	4. Add back current year's RnD, subtract out amortization of past 
	years' RnD to each years earnings
	5. Show umamortized RnD as asset, which increases book equity
  * Similar examples include advertising, recruiting, training, 
  exploration (for oil, e.g.), and customer acquisition

### Problems

1. Why are effective tax rates lower than marginal tax rates?
  * International taxes, tax deferral strategies, differences b/t 
  tax books and reporting books, and operating loss carry forwards
2. The primary reason RnD is treated as an operating expense rather 
than a capital expense is:
  * that RnD benefits are uncertain
3. When converting leases to debt:
  * Discount contractual lease commitments in future years back to 
  today, using the pre-tax cost of debt as the discount rate
4. When companies use options to compensate employees, earnings are: 
  * Lowered in the period of the grant by the estimated value of the 
  options at the time of the grant
5. Restricted stock cannot be claimed by employees until vested. The 
share count: 
  * Is increased at the time of the grant, weighted by chance of vesting

### Examples

Taxes
  * Wide range of effective tax rates among companies
  * Older companies have effective tax ~ marginal tax
  * Negative taxes from tax credits from gov't
  * Deferred taxes aren't real, but projections into the future

Non-debt commitments
  * Nordstrom lease payments are treated as 5-year annuity, then 
  discounted at 4.7% (from interest rates and risk of default)
  * Added to balance sheet in operating lease liabilites (under 
  current liabilities) and non-current operating lease liabilities 
  (under long-term debt)
  * This increases debt, but is counterbalanced by counter-asset 
  which depreciates
  * Formerly, the lease was considered an operating expense. Now 
  you add back to operating expenses (undo) and remove depreciation.
  * Taxes and net income do not change because one tax-deductible 
  expense (operating lease) is replaced with interest and depreciation 
  of equivalent value

Non-physical capital expenses
  * Use 2-10 years as amortizable life. 2 years for small tech, 3-5 
  years for hardware, 10 years for pharma
  * See video for spreadsheet walkthrough

Stock-based compensation
  * Netflix gave away lots of valuable options
  * Should be considered grants-in-kind, not non-cash expense

### Problems

1. Estimate change in pre-tax operating income if RnD is capitalized, 
assuming it takes 3 years to pay off
  * This year's RnD - total cumulative amortization = +8687 
2. Estimate change in book value of equity if RnD is capitalized, 
assuming it takes 3 years to pay off
  * Total unamortized portion over past 3 years = +45839
3. Estimate the debt value of the lease, assuming 25% tax rate, 
3% cost of debt, 8% cost of equity, and 7% cost of capital.
  * Discount all lease commitments back to present with 3% value, 
  then sum to +2,337
4. What is the effect of capitalizing the lease on operating income?
  * Lease expense from prior 12 months - depreciation of asset = 374 - 
  2337/10 = +140
5. What is the effect of capitalizing the lease on interest expense?
  * PV of lease commitments * pre-tax cost of debt = 2337 * 0.03 = 
  70.1
