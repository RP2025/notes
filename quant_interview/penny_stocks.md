# Penny Stocks for Dummies by Peter Leeds

Penny stocks are < $5, with $50M - $500M market cap

NYSE requires high fees and corporate obligations. AMEX and NASDAQ are 
good, but OTC-BB is main exchange. Avoid OTC (not OTC-BB) pink sheets.

Younger company that reacts with volatility
  * Lawsuits, IP, competition

Growth through growing market share, revenue/sales, employees, 
mergers+acquisitions, subscriptions, and order size.

Target niches in fragmented industries

## Business actions

Dilution through issuing new shares raises funds and expands shareholder 
base, but lowers value through lower proportional equity.
  * ✅ Good for raising funds for legal issues, acquisitions, and hiring.
  * ❌ Bad for paying execs or keeping company barely afloat.

Buybacks display confidence, reverses dilution, and increases demand.

Acquisitions require paying a premium and legal fees.
  * Can stymie further growth once big company takes over.
  * Likely if big players in industry are consolidating, and acquiring 
  is cheaper than building new business (high startup costs)

Mergers benefit from economies of scale, and prevent takeovers from bigger 
companies.

Stock split keeps prices low. Signals success and confidence.

## Good and bad

❌ Avoid bankruptcy (Q appended to ticker), pump-and-dump, marketing hype, 
bad financials, bad business idea that could never profit 
(shipping heavy cheap things, e.g.), overcrowded industry, and lawsuits.

✅ Seek good customer loyalty, returning orders/subscriptions, and broad 
client base.

## Strategy

First, paper trade while accounting for fees and recording results

Use limit orders to avoid issues with price jumps, low volume, and 
wide bid-ask spreads. 

Stop losses are good. Can get stopped-out on high-volatility stocks though.
  * Trailing stops follow uptrends to lock in profits.

Can diversify across industry, company size, share price, volatility, 
geographic region, and exchange

Scale into/out of stock over weeks or months so you can reconsider.

Don't average down, since it doesn't fix mistakes. Average up to 
confirm your predictions and boost further increases.

Take profit if gains are good, stock spikes, outlook is bleak, or trading 
volume declines (losing momentum)

## Research 

Figure out how company makes money, and how it could run into issues.

✅ Set price alerts and avoid wildly swinging prices with no reason. 
Subscribe to company's mailing list to get news. Read trade journals 
and local publications. Investor relations are generally good due to 
factual obligations. Follow market, sector, industry, and consumer trends.
  * Pay attention to press coverage (and their sources), the correlation of 
  news and price, and underappreciated milestones like awards

❌ Beware of free penny stock newsletters, forums, and hired analysts
newsletters.

Call IR and ask about headcount growth, sales breakdowns, competitors, 
employment length, sales growth, if they need more money, comparisons 
to industry trends.

Price captures expectations more than results for small-cap stocks.

Non-systemic (company-specific) downturns are serious. Market panics 
are not as serious because company is still good.

Industry/sector outlook, microeconomic changes (gas prices, taxes, wages), 
macroeconomic changes 

### Screens

Avoid low-quality exchanges like Pink Sheets OTC

Refine industry to one you know and is growing

Share price > $0.50, market cap > $100M, daily volume > 50k

Trading within 10% of 12-month high. Look for growth.

Remove holding companies, special classes of shares (.A or .B), suspicious 
generic names, hyper-specific industries, or specific countries

### Indicators

Revenue is growing without similar growth in advertising spending

Market share growth while others in industry are losing

Industry barriers-to-entry are high and rising

Customer attrition is low, with increasing order sizes

Sales grow > 25% per year and operational expenses grow < 10% per year

### Fundamental analysis

Income statement shows sales, costs to make sales, and operating expenses
  * Want cost of revenue (production) << revenue
  * Want operating expenses to not take huge cut of gross income

Balance sheet shows assets and liabilities broken into short and long term
  * ❗️ Can be warning sign of looming financial disaster
  * Short term (< 1 year) can be sold quickly
  * Ideally, current and net assets cover current and net liabilities
  * Should have enough cash to grow

Cash flow statement shows activity, like operating activites  
(from income statement), investing activities (real estate, equipment), 
financing activities (dividends, issuing bonds/shares), and
supplemental info (taxes, interest, FX rates)
  * Be suspicious of losses in investing activites -- will it continue?
  * Be suspicious of long-term reliance on financing to stay afloat 

Compare numbers to previous periods, competitors, industry/sector
  * Trends are more important than raw numbers -- look for growing 
  revenue, consistent debt payments, increasing assets, increasing 
  assets/liabilities ratio, increasing profit margins (benefitting from 
  economies of scale), 

Management is very influential for small firms -- look at their backgrounds
  * Look for prior experience, personal investment in company stock, and 
  not-huge (< $500k ) compensation
  * ❌ Don't put too much faith in insider buying/selling. 10-20% total is good.

### Finance ratios

Allows comparisons regardless of size or industry, giving more points 
of reference

Liquidity ratio -- ability to pay short-term debts
  * `Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities`
  * ✅ `Quick ratio = cash + accounts receivable + marketable securities / 
  current liabilities`. Useful bc not all assets are liquid. Want > 1.
  * `Cash ratio = cash + marketable securities / current liabilities`. 
  Useful bc not all customers may pay. Want > 1
  * `Operating cash flow = cash flow from operations / current liabilities`.
  Demonstrates good income, fiscal security, ability to use opportunities

Leverage -- ability to pay long-term debts
  * ✅ `Debt ratio = total liabilities / total assets`. Want similar to 
  industry, not expanding over time (can get out of control), with 
  increases only for business development.
  * `Debt to equity = total liabilities / total shareholder equity`. Tells 
  creditors vs. shareholders. > 1 indicates potential issues paying debt. 
  Not super useful
  * `Interest coverage = EBIT / interest expense`. Gives ease of paying 
  debt. Avoid < 2, especially < 1.

Activity ratio -- efficiency of using assets to produce revenue
  * Good to use average values over year.
  * Highly industry-specific (fast food is high vs. luxury cars is low)
  * ✅ `Inventory turnover = cost of goods sold / inventory`. Want 
  stability or slow growth. Decay indicates inventory pileup.
  * `Receivables turnover = sales / avg. accts. receivable`. Want > 4 
  regardless of industry. Gives # times / year company gets paid.
  Indicates diverse customer base who pays on time. Gives short-term cash.
  * `Payables turnover = sales / avg. accounts payable`. Want > 4 and 
  match to receivables turnover. Gives payment frequency, indicating 
  consistent debt payment.
  * `Working capital turnover = sales / avg. working capital`. Avg. working 
  capital = current assets - current liabilities. Indicates efficiency 
  of available cash to produce sales. Effective as trend, not as 
  comparison to other companies.
  * `Fixed asset turnover = sales / avg. fixed assets`. Avg. fixed assets 
  are factories, properties, equipment, etc. Useful only for firms with 
  significant fixed assets.
  * `Total asset turnover = sales / avg. total assets`. Can get > 10 for 
  small firms. Not super useful.

Performance aka profit margins -- profitability at level of sales
  * Tend to be small and improve slowly due to fulfillment costs, 
  supply costs (out of company's control), current fluctuations, and 
  competition.
  * `Gross profit margin = sales - cost of goods sold / sales`. Gives 
  ability to turn profit from goods sold. Highly industry-specific, 
  based on cost of goods sold.
  * ✅ `Operating profit margin  = operating income / sales revenue`. 
  Operating income = EBIT. Indicates effort to control costs. Like 
  gross profit margin but including operating costs. More comparable 
  between companies.
  * `Net profit margin = net income / revenue`. Net income = EBITDA. Like 
  operating profit margin but including all expenses. Usually very small 
  (1 - 9 percent).
  * `Return on assets = net income / avg. total assets`. Not super 
  useful bc small companies typically have no net income or assets.
  * `Return on equity = net income / avg. shareholder equity`. Not 
  super useful bc small companies typically have large equity positions.


Valuation -- value at level of stock price
  * Lower is better bc price is in numerator
  * Tend to dynamically shift due to price dependence
  * `Price to earnings = price per share / earnings per share over 
  last 12 months`. Can't work if no earnings, and doesn't account 
  for future possibilities. High for growth companies. Lower is 
  theoretically better, but could mean that investors don't believe in 
  the company.
  * `Price to earnings to growth = PEG = PE ratio / annual EPS 
  growth rate`. Good for small firms. Want < 3, esp. < 1.
  * ✅ `Price to sales = price per share / revenue per share`. Good 
  for small firms bc they typically have no earnings, just revenue. 
  Variable between industries. Hard to find < 1.
  * `Price to cash flow = price per share / cash flow per share`.

### Abstract review

Branding is unique image of company and its products
  * Superior customer experience, visual cues like color schemesm, 
  reputation + PR, accessibility and accountability like customer 
  service, playing into strengths like speed, reliability, affordability
  * Can let small company take customers from niches big companies 
aren't known for. The brand is the only real asset.
  * Look for consistency, good UX, open communication w customers (social 
media, e.g.), improvement, uniqueness, and simplicity.

Unique selling proposition = product unique to company.
  * Needs to offer significant benefit to consumer, be unique, and easily 
  marketable
  * ❗️ Logistics are even more important, bc the EASIEST product is 
  always chosen over the BEST product.

Evaluate customer acceptance by reading customer reviews, calling 
competitor and asking for pros/cons, trying out product.

Want large share of rapidly growing market. Find out about total 
current market size, potential market size, share breakdown by 
competitor, and changes over time.
  * Call company and/or check quarterly financial reports.
  * Jump on improvements before they're reflected in financials.

Want high barriers to entry to prevent competition.
  * Regulations, existing competition, customer loyalty, technical 
  requirements (engineering, e.g.), materials

First movers should move quickly, lock in market through IP and brand, 
and hope for many competitors to kill one another.
  * ❗️ Costs for educating the market can be high enough to kill the 
  first mover.

Figure out the expenses associated with marketing (5 - 20% is good), 
the efficacy, and the future plans.
  * Can ask company directly for marketing plan.
  * Marketing plan should be holistic, incl PR, media, ads, and good UX.
  * Marketing plan should be dynamic, dropping ideas that don't work.

High loyalty and low attrition lets company focus on capturing new clients.
  * Want repeat subscriptions, low customer turnover, and larger and 
  more frequent orders

### Technical analysis

Good way to find entry and exit opportunities.

Doesn't work as well for small firms due to lower volume.
  * Want > 3% outstanding shares traded each day, with turnover rate 
  < 50 days.

Can break down quickly. Be ready to find new patterns.

Significant change is doubling or halving volume
  * Can occur due to sudden event, or gradual improvements
  * Decreasing volume is rare, but generally indicates poor investor 
  interest.

Support levels generally occur at round numbers. Can take advantage 
by setting stop losses/limit orders just below/above.
  * Volume increases when support or resistance is broken
  * Once broken, it's done. Can flip to become resistance

Can hop onto up, down, or side trend. Make sure to identify when it ends.

Dramatic spikes are great time to take profit or enter position
  * Likely to come back if low volume, > 20% spike, no news event, 
  and/or immediate reversal

Long up (down) trend followed by resistance, sideways movement, and 
decreased (increased) volume indicates topping out (bottoming out).

Consolidation is turnover of shareholders from sellers (bearish) to 
buyers (bullish). Indicated by cup-and-handle pattern. Want > 20% volume.
  1. Sideways trading in tight range.
  2. Price falls to form left side of cup as sellers leave due to 
  low volatility. High selling.
  3. Sideways trading in tight range for a few weeks. Buyers enter.
  4. Price jumps as last of old sellers leave.
  5. Price falls suddenly, but only a little.
  6. Sideways trading in tight range forms handle.
  7. More buyers enter. High volume.

On balance volume = sum of [trading volume * (1 if positive day else -1)]
  * Indicates money going into / out of stock
  * Can compare monthly to yearly trends to get sense of overall movement
  * Closely correlated with share price, so could be indicator before price 
  responds

Momentum can identify trends
  * Crossover of short-term MA over long-term MA indicates buy or sell

Relative Strength Index tells overbought if > 70, oversold if < 30

Short interest > 20% indicates expected negative upcoming event
