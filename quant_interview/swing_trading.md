# Swing Trading for Dummies by Omar Bassal

Time scale is days to weeks, max 1-2 months

Top-down = find good market conditions, then sector, then 
industry, then companies

Bottom-up = screen for good companies, then find promising 
industries and sectors

## Technical analysis

Focuses on bull/bear market, trending/trading activity, 
buyer/seller strength and momentum, reversals, entry/exit.

Main features are support/resistance and volume.

4 Phases
1. Accumulation -- longest phase, price moves sideways between 
resistance and support, light volume
2. Expansion -- change in perception, volume increases 
3. Distribution -- sideways again, volume decreases, company 
overvalued
4. Contraction -- price falls. volume is unreliable indicator.

Use an hourly or daily candlestick chart

### Chart patterns

Chart patterns like the Darvas box (accumulation), head and 
shoulders (contraction), cup and handle (expansion), triangles 
(inflection point) help identify phases or opportunities.

Gapping on volume > 2x daily volume indicates potential buy.

Hammer (hanging man) pattern indicates bottoming (topping) out.

Bullish/bearish engulfing patterns completely cover prior day's 
candlestick. Indicates reversal.

Morning star = üîª‚ñ´Ô∏è üî∫ indicates bullish trend

Trendlines are more reliable the more times they touch the price.
  * Can indicate support or resistance
  * Usually are horizontal, though can be angled

### Indicators

Use trending indicators for trending markets (where mean 
reversion doesn't apply), and trading indicators for trading 
markets (where it does apply)
  * Trending = higher highs+lows, or lower highs+lows
  * Trading = support and resistance encountered

Plan for whipsaws and data errors that could trigger a technical 
indicator.

Two to three indicators are ideal. More indicators generate 
unreliable and inconsistent signals.

‚úÖ Enter/exit on day after signal is generated. Later is too late.

Divergences between indicators and price action are good entry/exit.

#### Trending indicators
Directional movement index (DMI)
  * Measures trend strength and direction. 
  +DMI gives bullish activity, -DMI gives bearish activity, 
  ADX gives difference. 14 days.
  * ‚úÖ Average directional index (ADX) = +DMI - -DMI. Measures 
  trend strength between 0 and 100 over the past 14 or 25 days. 
  ADX < 20 = trading, ADX > 30 = trending.
  * DMI crossovers are unreliable, as they are too volatile.

Moving averages 
  * Exponential is more sensitive than simple, as it up-weighs 
  recent price activity.
  * Always buy in direction of slope
  * ‚úÖ Stick to <18 day averages. 9 day is good.

1. Find trending stock (ADX > 30)
2. Buy once moving average has: 
  * Slope turns from flat/negative to positive
  * Short term crosses over long term
  * MACD crosses over its 9-day MA
3. Exit when:
  * ADX < 30, no longer trending
  * Short term crosses back over long term
  * Stop loss hit

Moving averages crossovers happen more frequently than slope 
changes. Use 4-day for short and 9-day for long.

Moving average convergence/divergence = 26-day EMA - 12-day EMA. 
Also has a MA of its own (MA of an MA)
  * ‚ùå Don't trade based off MACD crossing 0. Use 4-day and 
  9-day SMA crossover instead, or MACD and it's 9-day MA.
  * Be suspicious of new low/high unconfirmed by MACD crossing 
  its 9-day MA

#### Trading indicators

Use ADX < 20 to determine trading conditions

Stochastics -- %K plot shows current price relative to 
highest high and lowest low, typically over 14 days. 
%D is 3-day MA of %K.
  * Divergence occurs when higher high of price matches 
  lower high of stochastic. Indicates sellers gain steam.
  * Buy only when %K crosses above %D as well.
  * Wait for exit from overbought (80% mark) or oversold 
  (20% mark) rather than entry to avoid trending behavior.

Relative strength index (RSI) = ratio of avg. gain of up days 
vs. avg. loss of down days, over past 14 days.
  * Divergence found like stochastics
  * Can trade overbought/sold cycles like stochastics, but with 
  30% and 70% cutoffs
 
## Macroeconomics

Can compare developed markets to emerging markets, specific 
commodities to the general commodities index, etc.
  * Use a ratio chart between two indices. Can apply same 
  technical analysis as with stocks.
  * Can take advantage by trading index directly, or digging 
  into industry to find specific stocks. Want strong stocks 
  in strong groups 

### US Dollar

Fed sets short term interest, which correlates with strength 
of US dollar. People want to give USD to federal govt to get 
that interest rate.

Fiscal policy (spending) takes longer to impact USD. Negative 
correlation due to borrowing pressure and increased supply.

Stronger USD ‚û°Ô∏è  more investment in US stocks and bonds. Weaker 
USD ‚û°Ô∏è  commodities benefit.

### Commodities

Energy includes crude oil, heating oil, natural gas. Metal 
includes gold, silver, platinum. Livestock and meat includes 
cattle and hogs. Agriculture includes corn and soybeans.

Commodities are everyday goods. Rising prices indicate 
inflation.

Commodities correlate negatively with bond prices and positively 
with interest rates because inflation degrades bond yields.

### Bonds

Inflation causes bonds to suffer, since bond yields don't track 
inflation. They are very sensitive to inflation!

‚ùóÔ∏è Bond yields trend inversely with bond prices.

Bond interest rates are principal competitor to stocks

Bond prices correlate positively with stocks, and typically 
precede stock movements.
  * Except in deflationary periods

## Fundamental analysis

Balance sheet
  * Current ratio > 1.5 to ensure company can pay upcoming debts
  * < 30% long-term debt to shareholder equity ratio. Big 
  number indicates leverage
  * No big jumps in accounts receivable, which indicates extending 
  loose credit terms to boost sales
  * No big jumps in inventory, which indicates sales slowdown

Income statement
  * Net income growth rate > sales growth rate
  * Increasing gross profit as percentage of sales
  * Increasing operating income as percentage of sales
  * No substantial increase in outstanding shares (dilution)
  * ‚ùóÔ∏è Account for seasonality by comparing year-to-year rather 
  than quarter-to-quarter

Cash flow statement
  * Cash flow from operations correlates with net income. 
  Negative correlation indicates non-cash expenses.
  * Small levels of capital expenditure relative to sales
  * Want company to generate its own cash, not rely on borrowing

Price company relative to peers using financial ratios like P/E, 
P/S, P/book value, or others.
  * Higher P/E can be rationalized off better growth, operating 
  margins, or efficiency over peers

Absolute valuation based off earnings, cash flows, dividends, 
and expected future earnings is much more difficult.

Top-down: price the overall market with long-term P/E ratio, 
which compares current P/E to expected P/E in 12 months
  * Use operating earnings to avoid distortions from 1-time events.

Fed model determines over/undervalue by comparing market 
yield (inverse of P/E) to 10-year US Treasury Note yield 
or AA corporate bond yield. 

Bottom-up: screen for companies
  * Consider growth vs. value companies
  * See my trading plan for details

## Portfolio management

Limit max daily loss to 7% of total portfolio -- will require 
rebalancing and changing stop losses over time.

Diversify across sectors and industries. Ideally have 10 
positions open at a given time.
  * Top-down analysis can lead to sector overinvestment
