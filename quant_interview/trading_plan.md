# My trading plan

1. Size up the overall market
  1. Growth vs. Value - compare .RLG and .RLV charts
  2. Commodities/Bonds Yields should be decreasing, Dollar should 
  be increasing
    1. Commodities > Bonds - go inflation-sensitive (materials)
    2. Commodities < Bonds - go interest-sensitive 
	(real estate/utilities)
  3. S&P500 index
    1. Daily (6 months) - Trending up now (10/09/2017)
    2. Weekly (2 years) - Trending up now (10/09/2017)
    3. Inverse of P/E > AA 10-yr bond yield - Good
2. Pick a strong industry
  1. Plot a chart between S&P500 index and sector index
  2. Look at top industry performers in sector
  3. Growth - consumer cyclical, healthcare, IT, telecom
  4. Value - consumer staples, energy, financials, capital goods, 
  materials, utilities
  5. Make sure to diversify - at least 3 industries
3. Fundamental Analysis
  1. Always:
    1. Price > $5

    1. P/S < 1.25
    2. Dividend Yield > 1%
  4. Value companies relative to peers:
    1. Looking for higher earnings growth rate, return on equity, 
	and profit margin than peers
    2. Higher P/E, Price/Cash Flow, PEG, P/S → higher value
    3. Earnings growth rate at x% means P/E should be about x
  5. Consider Wall Street surprises

    1. If within next two weeks, don’t buy
4. Technical Analysis
  1. Look at weekly chart (1 year) for overall trends
  2. Look at daily chart (3 months) for local trends
